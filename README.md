## Installation

To set up the project and install dependencies (Tailwind), run the following command:

```bash

## Development

During development, you can use the Tailwind CLI to compile the `input.css` file. The compiled output will be saved in `css/main.css`. To watch for changes and automatically recompile, use:

```bash
npm run watch
```

If you only need to build the project once, use:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Usage

1. Install dependencies.
2. Run the development script to compile and watch for changes.
3. Build the project using the provided script if needed.

Feel free to customize and extend the landing page according to your client's requirements.
