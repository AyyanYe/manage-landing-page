# manage-landing-page
Built a landing page for a client, this is just a nerfed working model of what was originally build using HTML5, CSS3, VanillaJS and Tailwind CSS.

****Usage****
Install dependencies (Tailwind)
<br>npm install

Run the Tailwind CLI to compile the *input.css* during the development. The output file is **css/main.css**
<br>npm run watch

Or to just build once, type
<br>npm run build
